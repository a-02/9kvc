one of the first tracks created for work 1. the whole thing had a sillier more funny rave
type of energy behind it to start, and the tracks had hilarious titles based off the
samples used. there was one feature Jung an Tagen and Susan Alcorn to create the title
"Sus an Tagen". its fnuny because the word "sus" is in there. like from amongus. and its
the two sample names.
